## Project
### Introduction
In this study, we have conducted a detailed investigation of the dynamic behavior of an aquarium filled with water using the finite element modal analysis method. We have employed a weak formulation of the problem to highlight the coupling between the water and the structure of the aquarium. The fluid/structure interaction term has been discretized and incorporated into the matrix system to obtain precise solutions for resonance frequencies and associated deformation modes of the aquarium.

Our findings are significant for understanding the vibrations and deformation modes of the aquarium, which are crucial for optimizing, designing, and preventing structural failures. The precise solutions for the resonance frequencies and deformation modes can provide valuable information for designers and engineers to ensure that the aquarium is structurally stable and does not fail under various loading conditions. Moreover, this study can aid in the development of a predictive model for aquarium behavior, which can help in assessing the impact of external loads, such as seismic activity or water movements caused by marine life.
